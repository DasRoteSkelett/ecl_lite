    <p>
       The ecl-lite stack includes packages with few dependencies on either system
       or c++ functionality. This makes it ideal for very embedded builds where
       many of the usual mechanisms are unavailable.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No malloc/new</li>
      <li>No exceptions</li>
      <li>Minimal templates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       It also includes a few packages which standardise lower level
       api (e.g. posix/win32) with drop-ins to make them properly cross-platform,
